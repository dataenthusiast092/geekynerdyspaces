            Money is important and helps in following:
            <ul>
                <li>Food</li>
                <li>Clothing</li>
                <li>Health & Treatment along with good medication.</li>
                <li>For staying at home.</li>
                <li>For rainy days.</li>
                <li>Luxury(Eating out @ Restaurant / Cars / Luxury Apartments or Bungalow)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Never keep anything pending for long later unless you don't have a choice.</li>
        <li>Remember! "Divide & Rule the task in team work." No one can handle all the responsibilities. Even if s/he does, nobody will life if you give yourself all the credit and distributing the credit is what you won't accept and like.</li>
